# Project Euler Solutions
On this page I publish personal solutions for problems of [**Project Euler**](https://projecteuler.net).

<br>
<br>

## Jupyter Notebook
The solution sheets are created with the help of [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://jupyter.org).

<br>
<br>

## Why I am doing this?
I am continuously trying out different strategies for presenting and communicating technical solutions.
For example, in parallel I am working on creating presentation slides about
[**Dice Roll Odds**](https://sourcefranke.github.io/dice_roll_odds)
with the help of [**Slidev**](https://sli.dev).
